<h2>Why Us?</h2>
We at genious aim to develop competitive attitude amongst our students with equal focus on social responsibility, ethics and personal development. It is very important to cater the required skills for a student because today’s young minds will be the leader of tomorrow.
But without proper guidance this sounds like building a castle in the air. The institute provides assistance to its students in both English and Hindi medium for better understanding. We provide regular tuitions, revision classes, home tuitions, small group for tuitions so that our educationists can focus on all the children.
We also take personal feedback of the children in reference with the knowledge imparted to them at regular intervals. We at genious believe in professional teaching within a homely environment. Therefore to serve this need, we have a team of over 10 teachers from various fields of study.
Each of them has sufficient experience in their respective field.
We are very supportive in employing women as a part of our team.
Providing them a platform to showcase their talent and opening new door towards various career opportunities. Also, relieving them of their financial constraints.

<h2>Our Approach & Vision</h2>
Education is the basic necessity that every child should be blessed with. The growth and development provided by education cannot be complimented with any other service. We at genious feel that along with the typical school course and syllabi the children should also be instilled with morals and values. 
We think that in the competition to succeed the children are already burdened with a lot, 
they are in a pressure to choose between what interests them and what is the best for them.
We believe in providing the best educationist to a student in a stress free learning structure with a respectful environment where a student can ask their doubts without any inhibitions.
Home Tuitions
With the rapid development in the education system and equally increasing competition, maintaining top ranks at school level has become tough. Though a lot of institutes and independent personals provide home tuition,
how do you judge “WHO IS THE RIGHT TUTOR?” for your child. The professionals at genious not just proficient teachers but are known to have an “out-of-the-way” approach to help their students. Again, please do not treat your child differently only because he/she cannot score good marks. 
Our home tutors make sure the child grows in academics and other areas of their interest.
The growing competition in every field has obligated the parents to provide personal assistance for their child’s education. Below are the facilities provided by genious Home Tutors-
1.	Unique teaching methods
2.	24 hrs availability
3.	Academic counseling
4.	Develop analytical thinking, critical reasoning and innovative approach
5.	Syllabus Competition before time
6.	Revision & Back up Classes
